# bin
A collection of my standard user's bin/ directory (usually small helpful bash and/or perl programs)

Also, I was using this as a test so that I could get to know git and github.  

This is not really meant for the general use of others; I'm using this github remote for free, and 
therefore you (whoever you are) can see the contents of this repository.  Use whatever you find 
useful, but if you are an accomplished developer, you are not likely to find much of interest here.  

On the other hand, if you are learning bash/perl, you might learn a few tricks...  ;-)

YMMV
