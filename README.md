# bin
A collection of bash and/or Perl programs that I like to have in my UNIX user's home directory within the "~/bin" directory.

Also, I was using this as a test so that I could get to know and use git and the github website.

This is not really meant for the general use of others; I'm using this "github remote" for free, and therefore you (whoever you are) can see the contents of this repository. Use whatever you find useful, but if you are an accomplished UNIX developer, you are not likely to find much of interest here. ;-)

On the other hand, if you are learning bash/perl, you might learn a few tricks that I have picked up over the years... ;-)

YMMV
